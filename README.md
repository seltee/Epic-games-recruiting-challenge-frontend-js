# Remark

I have done this for interview to Epic Games and I have passed technical part quite easily and then was rejected by my level of english :D. Kinda funny. In "doc" folder you will find original task. Overall they just wanted me to make this project "better". Like with improving UX/UI, schedules, tables, transitions, etc.

To launch the app in dev mode run `yarn && yarn dev` and navigate to `localhost:8080`.

Spending 8 hours on this task, then 2 interviews about my skills and geting "your english is not fluent enough" in the end ... well, it was unpleasant. Such recruitment process is totally sucks.
